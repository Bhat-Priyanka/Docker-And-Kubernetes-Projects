# Docker-And-Kubernetes-Projects

## Overview

I am a software developer with 4+ years of experience of using C++, C#, WPF, bash and database management. As I wanted to learn cloud computing, I started preparing for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect exam and have obtained the certificate. After learning the theoretical concepts, I wanted to get practical experience working on Docker and Kubernetes. 

The purpose of creating this repository is to document some of the Docker related projects I have worked on. I will be writing the steps involved in each of the projects in detail and also will be attaching the screenshots from the AWS console and the results. I will be using draw.io software to create architectural diagrams. 

I hope this repository will help those who want to learn Docker and Kubernetes.

Credits: I have read various blogs and watched YouTube videos to get inspiration for creating these projects.
